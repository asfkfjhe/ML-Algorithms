# ML-Algorithms

This project showcases a collection of fundamental machine learning algorithms that I have implemented during my fellowship at Fuse Machine. These algorithms cover a wide range of topics in machine learning and data analysis, providing a valuable resource for both beginners and experienced practitioners in the field.

# Acknowledgments:
I would like to express my gratitude to Fuse Machine for providing me with the opportunity to work on these projects and learn from them. Additionally, I want to thank the open-source community for its invaluable contributions to the field of machine learning, which have greatly influenced this repository.
